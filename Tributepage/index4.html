                    This is Jomelyn, my mother and truly the mother of all. I call her the mother of all because she doesnt just take care of me and my little sister, but also looks after my cousins, grandpa, and even my uncles and aunties.
                    
                    Though she is a housewife, she remains strong and acts as a mother to all of us. She teaches us things we dont know about this world through her experience, helps us with government requirements, guides us on how life works, and shows us how to interact with people. She is the one we turn to whenever we have problems or dont know how to do something. In our household, she does the work of both a mom and a dad, managing everything in the house with strength and love.
